## What is PixelSketch?

A simple webpage that allows the user to draw on a customizable canvas and download their creations.

## Features

After setting the ideal canvas size, the user can choose between two painting modes:

* **Etch-a-Sketch**: as the traditional toys, this option allows the user to use the canvas as an [etch-a-sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch).
* **Pixel Art**: the user can pick their favorite colours to fill the canvas tiles.

At any moment the user can erase the already painted tiles and, once the job is finished, the download button will save the canvas as a PNG image.
